Alfred 2 Helpers and Workflows
=========

This repository contains my created Alfred 2 (http://www.alfredapp.com) workflows:

Leo Dictionary
---------
![Searching with leo](Leo%20Dictionary/screenshot_de.png)

Searches the Leo dictionary (http://dict.leo.org) for the languages german, english, french and spanish. Feeds back the results into Alfred for instantly seeing the translated word. When hitting 'Enter' the translated word is copied to the clipboard. When hitting 'Shift + Enter' the selected word translation is opened with Leo.
With Version 1.2 newly introduced a somewhat "automatic" detection of the language of the entered word. 

There are three ways to search Leo:
* de - Translating a german word to english and vice versa.
* df - Translating a german word to french and vice versa.
* ds - Translating a german word to spanish and vice versa.

- Opening Leo with the selected word when hitting 'Shift + Enter'.
